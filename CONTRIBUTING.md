## How to contribute to WSU Computer Science

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/CraftingGamerTom/wsu-computer-science/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/CraftingGamerTom/wsu-computer-science/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of WSU Computer Science will generally not be accepted. However, if the changes bring a significant improvement to poor readability or maintainability we will review the request.

#### **Do you intend to add new course information or change an existing information or code?**

* Suggest your change under [Issues](https://github.com/CraftingGamerTom/wsu-computer-science/issues) as a new feature request and start writing code.

* Do not create a pull request on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask any question about how to use [Issues](https://github.com/CraftingGamerTom/wsu-computer-science/issues) and label the issue as a question. Admittedly, if your question is clearly without previous research it will be closed without acknowledgement. 
* This repository is not stackoverflow and I am not your professor :)

#### **Do you want to contribute to the WSU Computer Science documentation?**

Please leave your suggestions as a new Issue and create a Pull Request with any changes.

WSU Computer Science is a volunteer effort. We encourage you to pitch in!

Thanks! :heart: :heart: :heart:
