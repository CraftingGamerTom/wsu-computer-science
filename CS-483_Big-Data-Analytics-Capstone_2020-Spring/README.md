## Title
Worcester Crimes Data â€“ Analysis and Predictions

## Abstract
The intent of this project is to understand a Worcester crime dataset. Some of the questions we ask are: 
- What are the most dangerous neighborhoods in Worcester? 
- What are the week days, time of the day with the highest crime rate? 
- Does a crime type depend of a geographical location? 
The project involves visualization and statistical analysis of the dataset. The use of heat maps serves a great role in understanding the most dangerous locations within the city. Facebook's Forecasting package, Prophet, will be used for the visualization and statistical analysis, as well as other R packages. We also will try to predict where a crime may occur in the future. We are using a variety of Data Mining algorithms to construct an effective prediction model. This would help the police move towards a proactive approach for policing rather than reactive approach. This can help us better understand how to make our city safer.
