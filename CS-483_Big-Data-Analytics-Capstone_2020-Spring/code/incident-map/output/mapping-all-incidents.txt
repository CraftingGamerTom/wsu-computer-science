I tried to map all of the incidents but the HTML file generated was 250MB. It took a few minutes to load into Sublime (text editor) and too over 5 minutes with 2 cores at 100% to load the page in Chrome. Even once it was loaded it would spike my CPU when I try to pan the page and no dots loaded. The HTML file was 4,250,000 lines long.
The original dataset had 231999 incidents

Decided to pick one year (2019) to display the crimes for.

I later decided to use Tableau (A tool for plotting data) to visualize the data and easily filter. I did not have to write any code for this. I was able to do this using a student license. This tool is amazing.
